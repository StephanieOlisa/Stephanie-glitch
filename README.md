## 🚀 About Me 
I’m a data analyst passionate about helping businesses turn data into clarity and confident decisions. I enjoy transforming complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights that drive real results.

I specialize in building interactive dashboards, automating workflows (including using Power Platform tools), and creating solutions that improve efficiency and support smarter planning. My goal is always to build systems that don’t just look good but actually get used.

With experience across different fields including agriculture, fashion, virtual assistance, and teaching, I bring a practical and well rounded perspective to problem solving. Outside of data, I love reading and watching inspiring or educational movies and videos that offer real-world lessons and fresh perspectives. I love the “aha!” moment when data uncovers something meaningful that can truly impact a business.

I believe data is most powerful when it is simple, actionable, and aligned with real goals.
